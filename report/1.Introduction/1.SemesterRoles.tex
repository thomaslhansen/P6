\section{Semester roles}
Since the project was so large with regards to the number of participants, the group responsible for the work process decided that all teams were to be full stack teams.
The advantage of this is that each group contains the capabilities to make an issue from the project backlog.
Based on the old reports from the last few semesters, that had been working on this project, the main problem was that one group would be waiting on another group to finish before their work could begin.
Another problem that earlier semesters faced were that some groups did not feel as if they were a part of the project, since they would only be working on their own little niche part of the project without interacting with the rest of the semester.

This new approach lead to the responsibilities of each group to be divided as can be seen on Figure~\ref{TBL:GroupResponsibility}.

This split was made, to make sure that every group was involved with every aspect of the project work.
