\section{Tools}
As a part of this project a number of different tools was used to facilitate the development done by the different groups.
In the following each of the different tools will be described. 

\subsection{GitHub}
For hosting the code of the Giraf project the previous semesters has been using GitLab in a self hosted environment. 
It was chosen to migrate from the self hosted GitLab to the regular GitHub.
This was primarily done so project did not have to maintain the GitLab instance and servers.
The GitHub has setup as an organisation so that all the different members of the project would add a team to the organization. On \autoref{GitHubOrg} the front page of the organization can been seen.

Each developer group where added as GitHub Teams as can be seen on \autoref{GitHubTeams} so it would be easier to assign the different groups to a given issue or simply to tag the entire group in a comment.

\subsection{Azure Pipeline}
With GitHub it is possible to integrate different solutions for testing that a given branch where up to the quality standard. 
Before each branch is able to merge it needs to pass two criteria. 
First it needed to be review by two developers and one representative from the product owner group. 
Additionally all checks implemented in the Azure pipeline would need to pass, as can be seen on \autoref{GitHubMergeControl}.

The checks implemented where both the Flutter linter that would check that the code design followed Flutter guidelines. 
The pipeline would also check if the flutter compile could compile with out any warnings/errors. 
On \autoref{GitHubPipeline} the build result of a pipeline run can be seen.
