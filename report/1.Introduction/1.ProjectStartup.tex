\section{Project start up}
Before the first sprint could start the two groups responsible for both process and costumer contact were given time to both formalise the common work process and to contact the costumers.
Once both groups where ready they were to present their work to the rest of the groups.

Once all groups were aware of the work process and the backlog of the project the first sprint could be planned and stated as described in Part~\ref{PART:Sprints}.
