The topic of the semester is 'Developing Complex Software Systems'.

The purpose of this project is to gain experience with development of a larger and more complex software system then the earlier semesters could justify. 
The project is structures as a multi group project where multiple groups where developing on the same codebase and with the same costumers. 

All groups work as full stack teams to ensure that the quality of the product could be as high as possible and to ensure a high throughput on user stories.

The software repository there the code is available can be found on \href{https://github.com/aau-giraf/}{GitHub} and the released version can be found on the \href{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dk.aau.cs.giraf.weekplanner}{PlayStore} and on the \href{https://github.com/aau-giraf}{AppStore}\todo{Fix this link when we have an apple app store location for the app}.
