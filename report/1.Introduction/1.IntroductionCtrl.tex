% This chapter is aimed to introduce both the subject of the project as well as our motivation for the project.
% It also aims to establish the initial problem statement, which the analysis will be conducted based on.
% This section should describe the basis of our project.
% really where our solution originates, based on a real world problem,
% even though our project is based on a "fun" project, it should still be possible to abstract it into real world applications

\section{Project start up}
Before the first sprint could start the two groups responsible for both process and costumer contact were given time to both formalise the common work process and to contact the costumers.
Once both groups where ready they were to present their work to the rest of the groups.

Once all groups were aware of the work process and the backlog of the project the first sprint could be planned and stated as described in Part~\ref{PART:Sprints}.
