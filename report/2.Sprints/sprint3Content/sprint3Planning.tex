\section{Planning}
This sprint planning was very short as we mainly planned using GitHub, as described in \autoref{sprint2Planning}, and the meeting was primarily to get a quick overview of which user stories were planned to be implemented in this sprint.
The user stories that we were to implement in this sprint are listed below.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Add activities to a weekplan
  \item Mark activity as complete
  \item Add weekplan
  \item Rearrange weekplan activities
  \item Remove activities from weekplan
  \item New font
  \item Implement guardian and citizen mode
  \item New WEB-API endpoint for getting all weekplans for a citizen
  \item Update WEB-API frameworks
  \item Migrate WEB-API to docker
  \item Migrate MySQL Database to docker
\end{itemize}

These user stories were available for self assignment on GitHub, meaning each group simply picked any issue that they wanted to be responsible for implementing.
To avoid conflict with the choices of other groups, the PO group still had to sign off on a user story being assigned to a specific group.
