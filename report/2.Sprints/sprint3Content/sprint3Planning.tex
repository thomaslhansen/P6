\section{Planning}
This sprint planning was very short as we mainly planned on using GitHub, as described in \autoref{sprint2Planning}, so the meeting was primarily to get a quick overview of what user stories that were planned to be implemented in this sprint. 
The user stories that we were to implement in this sprint are listed below.

\begin{itemize}
\item Add activities to a weekplan
\item Mark activity as complete
\item Add weekplan
\item Re-arrange pictograms
\item Remove activities from weekplan
\item New font
\item Implement guardian and citizen mode
\end{itemize}

These user stories were available for self assignment on GitHub.
So each group simply picked any issue that they wanted to be responsible for implementing.
