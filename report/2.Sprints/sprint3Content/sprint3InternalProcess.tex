 \section{Internal Process}
Since the development process model shift conducted from sprint 1 to sprint 2, the group worked based on the Waterfall model. 
During sprint 3 the same model was used with great success and to great satisfaction within the group. 

Then comparing our internal process to the other groups we see that the same amount of work is roughly being completed by all groups, with respect to the different amount of developers in each group. 
Thus the waterfall process is a valid choice for smaller development teams of 4-5 people, where as the 6 people teams can more fully utilise the Scrum process model.
