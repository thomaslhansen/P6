\section{Sprint retrospective}
In the sprint retrospective, we used \href{https://www.google.com/sheets/about/}{Google Sheets} to allow everyone to write their comments and suggestions for the sprint execution.
After a while the process group assembled the comments and suggestions to make a questionaire with \href{https://www.google.com/forms/about/}{Google Forms} to let everyone vote on the comments and suggestions.

The suggestions that were to be implemented are listed below.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Stand ups should focus more on explaining what each groups user story is about, to discover dependencies between groups more easily
  \item If you are assigned to a user story that you discover is blocked by another user story, then you should add a note that it is blocked by said user story and you should also unassign yourself from said user story
  \item Each pull request should only fix/concern one user story, unless they overlap
  \item Read through the entire pull request for every review and re-review
  \item When assigned to a user story you should review it on the same day, unless it is not possible, in which case you should inform the author of the pull request
  \item Be more active on Slack, at least once a day
  \item Contact PO group if you do not have any user stories
  \item Contact PO group if your user story will not be completed in the current sprint, and if possible talk about why and what knowledge or resource is needed, to see if it is possible to resolve it
\end{itemize}
