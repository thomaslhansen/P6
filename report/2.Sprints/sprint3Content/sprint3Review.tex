\section{Sprint review}
The process group had, during the sprint, come to the conclusion that the way we held sprint reviews was very reminicent of the stand-up meetings.
Therefore they had decided to not have any sprint review this sprint, or in future sprints. 

We were personally surprised to learn of this, as there was no announcement of it and did not notice it until we needed to document it.
