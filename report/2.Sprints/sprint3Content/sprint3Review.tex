\section{Review} \label{SEC:sprint3review}
The process group had during the sprint, come to the conclusion that the way we held sprint reviews was very reminiscent of the stand-up meetings.
Therefore they had decided to not have any sprint review in this, or future sprints. 

Our group was very surprised to learn about this, as it was not announced and therefore we did not notice it until we needed to document it.
