\section{Meta groups}
During this sprint the meta groups have been used in different ways. 
In the following the different groups activities will be elaborated and evaluated.

\subsection{Frontend}
Throughout this sprint the frontend meta group saw very little action, since by this point of the project most frontend related issues had been sorted out. 
Hence the group has fulfilled its purpose for this project and will no longer act as an active group.

\subsection{Backend}


\subsection{Server}
