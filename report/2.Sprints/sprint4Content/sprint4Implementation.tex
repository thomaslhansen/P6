\section{Implementation}
As described in \autoref{SEC:Sprint4Issues} the group where to work on \href{https://github.com/aau-giraf/weekplanner/issues/121}{issue \texttt{\#}121} where the app bare should be reduced in functionality when in "citizen mode". 
Throughout this sprint other, non GitHub, issues has also been solved.
In the following section the implementation and other issues will be discussed and elaborated upon.

\subsection{App bar in citizen mode}
The group was assigned to the issue of minimizing the functionality of app bare when in citizen mode. 
This was deemed as an easy functionality to fix and the group hence only assigned one member to implement it. 

The original plan was to change the app bar then chancing to citizen mode by instantiating a new app bar with the reduced buttons. 
However since another group had changed the way the app bar works it was quite hard for the group to actually implement it in this order.
This shift in the implementation meant that none of the group members where aware of an implementation that could solve the issue. 

Once aware of the issue, the group contacted the PO group for assistance. 
The group was then unassigned from the issue and the group who had written the new app bar implementation had an quick way of fixing the issue. 
Further information regarding the implementation can be seen at \href{https://github.com/aau-giraf/weekplanner/pull/262}{GitHub Pull Request}.
