\section{Planning}
The PO group assigned 1 issue per group this sprint, as they wanted to make absolutely sure that there were no incomplete issues in this sprint. 
They did their best to assign each group to issues related to something that they had previously worked on.
This was again a change in the working method, as in the previous sprint we simply assigned ourselves to any open issue on GitHub.

To make sure that we delivered a minimum viable product the PO group had also planned a couple of usability tests, one at the beginning of the sprint and one at the end.

The PO group also mentioned what functionality that they wanted the app to have at the end of the sprint.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Delete weekplan
  \item Timer for activities
  \item Mark activity as annulled
  \item Expansion of mark mode
\end{itemize}

All of these functions should be available if the issues that the PO have assigned the different groups to are completed.
