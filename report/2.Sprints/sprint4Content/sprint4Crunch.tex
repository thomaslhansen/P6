\section{Sprint crunch}
To check whether all the issues had been correctly implemented during the sprint, the PO group had a document that listed all the issues and who were to check which, so that we could find any new bugs or perhaps inadequate implementations.

We were assigned to check three issues.
All of the issues had been fixed adequately, but when checking one of the \href{https://github.com/aau-giraf/weekplanner/issues/128}{issues}, "When changing from citizen to guardian, the password is saved in the input field", a bug was discovered.
The issue was technically fixed, but there was a bug related to it; When entering a wrong or empty password the user would not get any error message stating that the password was incorrect.
Additionally the user would also not be able to switch to guardian mode with the correct password after having entered a wrong or empty password.
This meant that we had a new \href{https://github.com/aau-giraf/weekplanner/issues/253}{issue}.

%Thomas helped Morten and Thue with some server/API?


Another group discovered an issue with moving files on linux systems through the API.
%I guess Thomas knows about this in more detail
