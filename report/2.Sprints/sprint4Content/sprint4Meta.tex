\section{Meta groups}
Throughout this sprint each of the three meta groups were used to varying degrees. 
In the following the use of each group will be elaborated upon. 
 
\subsection{Frontend \& Backend}
During sprint 3 the frontend meta group was deactivated and throughout sprint 4 there was no need for it to be reactivated. 
During sprint 4 the backend group saw no action since the backend, at this point of the project, was at such a stable state that it was not needed to reactivate the group.
However each group could still develop new features into the backend and get them merged into production. 

\subsection{Server}
Throughout sprint 4 the server meta groups saw little action, but was at times used to discuss issues the other developers experienced that might have been server related. 
Some of the issues were not directly server issues but was easier for the server group to solve, for example performing a database migration based on some new API structure.
