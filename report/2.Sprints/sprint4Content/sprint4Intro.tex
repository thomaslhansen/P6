This last sprint of the Giraf project had the goal of making a minimum viable product and to create documentation of the development for next years students.
This meant that we were prohibited from working on the app after this sprint to avoid inconsistencies between the app and the documentation.

The sprint was planned to start on of 30\textsuperscript{th} of April and end on 14\textsuperscript{th} of May, so a total of 15 workdays.
