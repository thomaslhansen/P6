\section{Internal Process}
Throughout this project, two different development models has been used by the group for its internal work.
It was during sprint 1 discovered that do to the small development team, we could not fully utilise the Scrum development model and the change to waterfall was hence chosen. 
This change resulted in both higher efficiency and greater utilisation of the developers with in the team.

The overall assessment by the group is that for any development team of a size of 4-5 people the waterfall development model is a good choice.
