\section{Internal Process}
Throughout this project, two different development models have been used by the group for its internal work.
During sprint 1 we discovered that, due to the small development team, we could not fully utilise the Scrum development model and the change to waterfall was hence chosen. 
This change resulted in both higher efficiency and greater utilisation of the developers within the team.

Throughout this sprint the same method from sprint 3 was used.
Throughout the sprint there were no issues experienced by the group, and thus there where no need to change the process. 

The Waterfall process had now proven itself through 3 sprints, within our group, and has fulfilled our needs and desires.
If the project group were to make the project all over, it is a common agreement that the same process model should be used. 

The overall assessment by the group is that for any development team of a size of 4-5 people the waterfall development model is a good choice.
