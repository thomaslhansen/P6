\section{Issues}\label{SEC:Sprint4Issues}
Seeing as this group previously worked on the appbar, making a password confirmation prompt when going from citizen mode to guardian mode, our assigned issue for sprint four (\href{https://github.com/aau-giraf/weekplanner/issues/121}{Issue \texttt{\#}121}) also had its ties to the appbar:

\textbf{Issue 121 - As a citizen, the appbar should only show the icon "change to guardian mode" icon.} In its current state, the app does complete a contextual change from guardian mode to citizen mode, and then removes the buttons leading to settings, editing, or logging out of the app, as can be seen on \autoref{GuardianModePre121} and \autoref{CitizenModePre121}.
However, it does not remove the back button in the upper left corner, which, when pressed in the current state of the app, leads to the screen where one would choose between the stored schedules.

This is not the intended behaviour, as the citizen is not supposed to be able to switch between stored schedules - this is a functionality reserved for the guardian.
\autoref{CitizenModeProto} shows how the app screenshot should look, and therefore also acts as a goal to be reached when solving this issue.
