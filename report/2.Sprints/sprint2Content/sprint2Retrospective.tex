\section{Retrospective}
To propose ideas and suggestions for improving the workflow of the Giraf project, we used \href{https://dotstorming.com/}{dotstorming} to create a brainstorm of all the ideas. 
Once we had a board full of ideas and suggestions everyone were able to pick their top 3 ideas to vote for.

The changes and additions to the Giraf process are listed below.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Make the crunch a day where we sit and work together in one large room
  \item When making a pull request, you should always include a screenshot of what you made
  \item Linter should give an error instead of a warning for not documenting publice members
  \item Have a testing workshop event
  \item Make the PO group approve every weekplanner pull request to check the design
\end{itemize}
