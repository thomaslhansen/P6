\section{Sprint crunch}
This crunch period was the first that led up to an actual release of the app.
It was structured such that, the day leading up to the release we were to get as many features in as possible; by having group sessions between pull request authors and reviewers, as described in \autoref{sprint2ImplementationWorkProcess}.

The rest of the crunch was on the release day where the focus was on fixing bugs, as to not introduce more bugs with new features just before releasing. 
We worked on fixing a bug where the logout button did not redirect the user to the login screen after logging out successfully.
We managed to get it fixed before the app was released.
