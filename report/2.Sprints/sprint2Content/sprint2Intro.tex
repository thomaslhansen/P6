This sprint was focused on making the Flutter app more user friendly and improve the user experience compared to the, now old, Xamarin app.
In order to make the app more user friendly we were to implement more basic functionality into the Flutter version of the app, as it was very lacking at this point.

The sprint was to start on the 18\textsuperscript{th} of March and end on the 5\textsuperscript{th} of April. 
This gave us 15 workdays for this sprint.
