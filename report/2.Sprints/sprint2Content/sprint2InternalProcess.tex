\section{Internal Process}
Once sprint 2 was completed, the group looked at our internal process and compared it to the process of sprint 1. 
After sprint 1 the internal development model was chanced to Waterfall where the rest of the project still worked by the Scrum model.

Then comparing the two sprints, we felt that less of our time was wasted on meetings since all group members already knew that the rest of the group was doing. 
With regards to the issues assigned during the planning phase, was assigned internally to the individual. 
Overall all issues was completed on time and to a degree that made the PO group satisfied with the solutions developed. 

Then looking back at the sprint the overall feeling and agreement inside the group, was that the Waterfall development model was much better suited to our group. 
It would thus be reused for future sprints.
