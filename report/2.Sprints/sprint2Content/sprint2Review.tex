\section{Sprint review}
During the review meeting the app was demonstrated and the state of the issues on GitHub were discussed.
Some issues were still open from the sprint, but the app should be at a state where it was stable.
As there were some issues leftover both from this sprint and some that were still present from the xamarin app a cleanup was needed.
