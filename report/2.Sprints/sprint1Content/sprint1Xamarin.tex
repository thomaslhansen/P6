\subsection{Xamarin framework issue}
The core of the issue was that the frontend of the app had been switched to the xamarin framework and this was not officially supported for GNU/Linux and there were no plans to make it officially supported \cite{xamarinSupport}.

So to mitigate this for us and future work we wanted to see if it was a viable and desired option to switch to another framework that was supported on all OS, such that we would not have to use a virtual machine with Microsoft Windows or Mac OS to compile and test any changes, which would not be an optimal solution.

We first considered whether we should switch to another framework at all.
For this discussion the frontend meta group held a meeting, where all were invited to listen in, as this was a big decision to be made.
The meeting resulted in the decision to switch to a new framework called flutter, but before the decision was final those attending the meeting were to discuss it with their respective group and perhaps get some input that was not brought up during the meeting.
Now a final meeting was held to discuss how the process should be handled.
It was decided to handle the switch by letting a group of volunteers dedicate the weekend to write the core part of the frontend into flutter, and then to start everyone up the Monday would be used to make small/easy user stories that would be used to get started with flutter on Tuesday.
