\section{Planning}
The sprint planning was held on the 25\textsuperscript{th} of February, and was done by having a meeting with the entire Giraf organization present. 
The product owner group presented some user stories as well as what the goal of the project was. 
The customers wanted more stability and reliability in the apps that already works, and did not care whether new and exciting functionality was added. 

After the presentation, each group picked three user stories that they wanted to complete, even though the user stories was not necessarily a high priority for the project. 
The idea was that the groups got something they wanted to work with as a startup and would then later pick based on priority.

Each group was assigned one of their top three user stories, and the user story was then estimated on how long it would take to complete.
If the group were able to complete the user story early in the sprint, they could ask the PO group for additional user stories.
Hence the PO group could make sure that all user stories assigned in the sprint were completed during the sprint.
