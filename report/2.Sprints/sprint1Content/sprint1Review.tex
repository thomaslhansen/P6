\section{Sprint Review}
As a part of Scrum of Scrums we held a review meeting, where we discussed what progress had been made that was relevant to the product.
Most groups did not make any significant progress.
This was mostly due to the issues encountered with xamarin.
There were no user stories that had been completed fully yet, and those that were had not been reviewed yet, so our greatest progress was that we had discovered some flaws and missing functionality in the core that had been written over the weekend.

Some of the flaws that were discovered were when loggin out the app would crash once it reached the login screen, as the login screen had some flaws in it, this was an issue with the core that had been written over the weekend.
The group that wrote the core would work on this issue at a later time as it did not present itself as urgent.

A couple of groups had an issue where they did not know what the proper way to send and recieve data from screen to screen was.
The usual way would be to use the constructor, but this was not possible yet.
It was possible to write the code that would do it, but it would simply not be able to communicate yet.
This was suggested to be solved later by the same group that wrote the core, as this was something that should be part of the core.
