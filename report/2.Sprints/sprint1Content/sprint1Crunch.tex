During sprint 1 the biggest problem was that many of the developers were unable to work on the project due to compatibility problems with the Linux operating system and the Xamarin framework. 
As a result hereof, it was deemed important to move to an more widely supported platform as quickly as possible. 

This was the responsibility of the front end meta group since the migration was solely a front end change. 
Since the entire project was stalled by this migration the frontend group set in an entire weekend and migrated form the existing Xamarin to Flutter.
