\section{Encountered issues}
During the sprint we encountered some issues with the framework xamarin, the framework that the frontend of the app was written in. 
About a third of the giraf organization were on the OS GNU/Linux and unable to compile; those that were able to compile could either not sign the apk file or were unable to install the app onto a tablet with the apk file.
So to resolve this issue the frontend meta group had a "emergency" meeting where the issue would be discussed.
