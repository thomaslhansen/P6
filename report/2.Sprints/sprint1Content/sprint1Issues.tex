We were not certain of the time it would take to complete the user story that we had picked (\href{https://github.com/aau-giraf/wiki/issues/17}{Issue \texttt{\#}17}), especially as another group had a user story (\href{https://github.com/aau-giraf/wiki/issues/9}{Issue \texttt{\#}9}) that potentially could conflict with some parts of our user story, hence this conflict had to be resolved.

\textbf{Issue 17 - As a guardian I would like to confirm with a password that the system is changing to guardian mode so that a citizen cannot gain access to it} was the user story assigned to our group, which was regarding authentication of a guardian entering guardian mode, as indicated by its title.

\textbf{Issue 9 - As a guardian, I would like that the app is fully available offline so that I can still use it if the internet is down} was the user story assigned to the other group, of which the crux is also self-explanatory by its title.

As our user story was regarding authentication and the other group's were to make the entire app work offline, including login authentication, an agreement to who would work on what had to be found, such that we would avoid duplicate work.
As our issue only contained frontend work while the other issue only concerned the backend, we agreed that the other group would resolve the backend work and we would work on the frontend part of our user story and then use the new login functionality that the other group made.
