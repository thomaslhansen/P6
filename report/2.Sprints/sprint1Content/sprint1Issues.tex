\section{Issues}
We were not certain of the time it would take to complete the user story that we had picked, especially as another group had a user story that potentially could conflict with some parts of our user story, hence this conflict had to be resolved.
The user story that was assigned to us and the other group were as follows:

Our user story: "As a guardian I would like to confirm with a password that the system is changing to guardian mode so that a citizen cannot gain access to it". (see  \href{https://github.com/aau-giraf/weekplanner/issues/17}{Issue \texttt{\#}17})

The other group had the user story: "As a guardian, I would like that the app is fully available offline so that I can still use it if the internet is down" (see  \href{https://github.com/aau-giraf/weekplanner/issues/9}{Issue \texttt{\#}9}) 

So as our user story was regarding authentication of a guardian entering guardian mode and the other group's were to make the entire app work offline, including login authentication, an agreement to who would work on what had to be found, such that we did not get any duplicate work.
As our issue only contained frontend work while the others only concerned the backend we agreed that they would resolve the backend work and we would work on the frontend part of our user story and then use the new login functionality that they made.
