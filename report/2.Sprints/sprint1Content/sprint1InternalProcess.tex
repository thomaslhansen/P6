\section{Internal Process}
During the project start up phase, we decided to work based upon the Scrum development process model.
This was decided since the last semester had worked with, and recommended, the Scrum of Scrums method. 

Throughout sprint 1, we worked by parts of the Scrum process, namely the Daily Stand ups, Review and retrospective. 

However after sprint 1 we evaluated upon the sprint and realized that since the group was of such a small size, each of the Scrum parts was actually being conducted "on the fly" within the group and was thus never formalized. 

As a consequence of this, we decided to look at the Waterfall development model, since it has a much smaller overhead for small development teams. 
It was also deemed unlikely that the PO group were to make any larger changes to an issue during a sprint and thus the agile development model was discarded.
