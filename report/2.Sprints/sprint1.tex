The first sprint had the purpose of getting to know the codebase, how the whole project was structured, and work out any potential problems with the work process. 
The amount of actual work on the product was not expected to be as high as future sprints, as we were not familiar with the codebase yet and needed some time to learn how the system worked. 

The sprint was planned to start on 25\textsuperscript{th} of February and end on 18\textsuperscript{th} of March so a total of 16 workdays.
