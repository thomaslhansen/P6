\section{Teamwork}
Throughout the project the group has been working together, for some group members for the first time, in various ways. 
The the following the teamwork will section we will elaborate on the teamwork in different aspects. 

\subsection{Communication}
Throughout the project the primary mean of communication has been via Slack. 
By using Slack it meant that each group member was contactable most of the normal working hours.
This made it easy to communicate throughout the group. 
Then a given group member was unreachable on Slack, the phone network was utilized as a secondary mean of communication.
It agreed upon that Slack was not the ideal communication tool, however it is the best alternative available.

When communication with staff at AAU the primary mean of communication was via email.
If however an unexpected long response time was experienced it was found to be more effective to make a physical appearance the once office.
This was especially useful then dealing with ITS.

\subsection{Attendance}
During the start up phase of the project there was a desire within the group to have regular meetings everyday from 0815-1600 o'clock.
However during the project period these times where largely abandoned, but the common agreement was still that the group would sign in between 0800 and 0900.
It was deemed unnecessary to dictate a specific time of meeting, however a single timeslot made it easier for the group. 
The finish time was also abandoned since there was no reason to stay at the group rum if the productivity had dropped.
Hence there was no formal specification on when and where the group work should be conducted, but there was however an oral agreement on how the work should be conducted.
