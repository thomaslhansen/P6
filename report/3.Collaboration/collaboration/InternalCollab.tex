\section{Teamwork}
Throughout the project the group has been working together, for some group members for the first time, in various ways. 
The following section will elaborate on the teamwork in different aspects. 

\subsection{Communication}
Throughout the project the primary mean of communication has been via Slack. 
By using Slack it meant that each group member was contactable most of the normal working hours.
This made it easy to communicate throughout the group. 
When a given group member was unreachable on Slack, the phone network was utilized as a secondary mean of communication.
It was agreed upon that Slack was not the ideal communication tool. 
However, it is the best solution, that is known and available to us.

When communicating with the staff at AAU the primary mean of communication was via email.
If, however, an unexpected long response time was experienced, it was found to be more effective to make a physical appearance in the staff member's office.
This was especially useful then dealing with ITS.

\subsection{Attendance}
During the start up phase of the project there was a desire within the group to have regular meetings everyday from 0815-1600 o'clock.
However, during the project period these times where largely abandoned, but the common agreement was still that the group would sign in between 0800 and 0900 o'clock.
It was deemed unnecessary to dictate a specific time of meeting, however a single timeslot made it easier for the group. 
The finish time was also abandoned since there was no reason to stay at the group room if the productivity had dropped.
Hence there was no formal specification on when and where the group work should be conducted, but there was an oral agreement on how the work should be conducted.
