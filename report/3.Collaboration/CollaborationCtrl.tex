\chapter{Intercollaboration}\label{CAP:Intercollaboration}
Since this project is a multi group project, it is inevitable that the individual groups would make collaborative work across the entire project. 
In the following chapter, some of the collaborative work conducted during the project will be elaborated upon. 

The following sections are written in collaboration with other groups and these will thus be identical with the same sections in their reports.
